## A New Beginning

Welcome to the blog section of Fiftymillimeter. This space will serve as a home for stories behind the images, technical explorations, and reflections on the photographic process. Whether you're a fellow photographer or simply curious about the work, I hope you'll find something of interest here.

Photography is as much about seeing as it is about capturing. Each image represents a moment of discovery—finding the extraordinary within the ordinary, recognizing patterns in chaos, or appreciating the quiet beauty of everyday scenes. Through these posts, I'll share insights into what draws me to particular subjects, the decisions made in the field and during post-processing, and the ongoing evolution of my artistic vision.

This blog will explore both the technical and philosophical aspects of photography. From discussions of gear and technique to musings on composition and visual storytelling, the goal is to provide a deeper context for the work showcased in the galleries.
