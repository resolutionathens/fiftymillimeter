## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Nuxt Content over Astro - keeps stack unified with existing Nuxt 4 app
- Blog images with content, not R2 - simpler architecture, separate concerns
- Categories without tags - simpler organization
- No comments - keep blog read-only
- **[01-01]** Used libSQL file-based database for Nuxt Content during development (instead of D1)
- **[01-01]** Used queryContent composable with useAsyncData for content queries

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**[01-01]** Harmless warning: content/blog/.gitkeep generates "parsing failed" warning from Nuxt Content. Will disappear when markdown files are added.
