            About Me
          </h1>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 pb-6">
            I am Ian Kennedy, a photographer based in Athens, Georgia. My work is a reflection of my
            love for the ordinary and the beauty that can be found in the everyday.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 pb-6">
            In 1976, William Eggleston's MoMA exhibition was dismissed by one critic as 'perfectly banal, perhaps.'
            Today,
            while many still question his work, we understand that he was revealing the extraordinary within the
            ordinary.
            I hope to embrace his democratic vision, finding magic in the mundane corners of the contemporary Southeast
            and beyond.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 pb-6 ">
            Like Eggleston’s haunting and challenging 'Democratic Forest,’ I intend these photographs to resist easy
            categorization or immediate gratification. A backyard grill in Tucson AZ, an empty parking lot in Athens GA,
            a
            table set for the 4th of July wherever that may be… I want each image to ask the viewer to pause and
            reconsider what deserves attention, what merits preservation. In documenting both my regional surroundings
            and
            travels, I seek those fleeting moments where the familiar becomes foreign, where banality transforms into
            beauty.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 pb-6">
            These images are meant to challenge conventional notions of the picturesque, inviting viewers to question
            not
            just what makes a good photograph, but what makes anything worth seeing at all.
